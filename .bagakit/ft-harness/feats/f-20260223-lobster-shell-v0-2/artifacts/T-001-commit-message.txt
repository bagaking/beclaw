feat(f-20260223-lobster-shell-v0-2): task(T-001) bootstrap lobster-shell v0 bridges

Plan:
- Feat Goal: Convert current brainstorm into tracked feat and ship initial harness artifacts.
- Task: Bootstrap lobster-shell v0 control plane (inbox -> long-run -> memory -> reply)

Check:
- `bash .codex/skills/bagakit-feat-task-harness/scripts/feat-task-harness.sh validate-harness --root .` => PASS
- `python3 .bagakit/lobster-shell/scripts/feishu_longrun_daemon.py --root . --self-check` => PASS

Learn:
- Long-run runner depends on `BAGAKIT_LONG_RUN_SKILL_DIR`; local wrappers are required for repo-local skill paths.
- `detection.status=ready` in execution-table is mandatory before any one-shot dispatch can pass `check_and_resume`.
