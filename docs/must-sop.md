# Project SOP

This SOP is generated from docs frontmatter. Do not edit manually.

## Update Requirements
- When a document with SOP frontmatter changes, regenerate this file and commit the result:
  - `export BAGAKIT_LIVING_DOCS_SKILL_DIR="${BAGAKIT_LIVING_DOCS_SKILL_DIR:-${BAGAKIT_HOME:-$HOME/.bagakit}/skills/bagakit-living-docs}"`
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_DOCS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/living-docs-generate-sop.sh" .`
- Add new SOP items by updating the `sop` list in the source document frontmatter.
- Keep SOP items small and actionable; use the source document for details.

## SOP Items

### Doc Co-Authoring Workflow (Guidelines)
Source: `docs/guidelines-doc-coauthoring.md`
- Use this workflow when drafting substantial docs (proposals, specs, decision docs, RFCs).
- Update this doc when your team changes its doc-writing workflow or quality bar.
- Regenerate `docs/must-sop.md` after SOP/frontmatter changes.

### Maintaining Reusable Items (可复用项维护)
Source: `docs/norms-maintaining-reusable-items.md`
- At the start of each iteration, check whether the project needs a new reusable-items catalog for an active domain (coding/design/writing/knowledge) and create/update it.
- When introducing or updating a reusable item (component/library/mechanism/token/style pattern/index; including API/behavior/ownership/deprecation), verify the relevant catalog entry is correct and update it in the same change.
- When SOP/frontmatter changes in these docs, regenerate `docs/must-sop.md` with `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_DOCS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/living-docs-generate-sop.sh" .`.

### Adopting Living Docs in an Existing Project
Source: `docs/notes-adopting-living-docs.md`
- Read this doc before adopting Bagakit living-docs into a repo that already has documentation under `docs/`.
- Update this doc when the repo's adoption/migration strategy changes (e.g., naming rules, CI gating, or legacy-doc handling).
- Regenerate `docs/must-sop.md` after SOP/frontmatter changes.

### Continuous Learning (Default)
Source: `docs/notes-continuous-learning.md`
- At the end of a Bagakit Agent work session, capture a draft learning note into `docs/.bagakit/inbox/` (manual or via `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_DOCS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/living-docs-learning.sh" extract --root . --last`). The default extractor upserts into a daily file to avoid fragmentation.
- Weekly (or before major releases), review `docs/.bagakit/inbox/` and promote durable items into `docs/.bagakit/memory/`.
- When promoting, keep entries short and source-linked; prefer `decision-*`/`preference-*`/`gotcha-*`/`howto-*` over long narratives. If the curated target already exists, merge instead of creating duplicates.

### Response Directives (Examples)
Source: `docs/notes-directives-examples.md`
- Read this doc when you want to introduce or change response directives (`directives:` in doc frontmatter).
- Keep directive usage practical: only add directives that reduce mistakes or improve debuggability.
- Regenerate `docs/must-sop.md` after SOP/frontmatter changes.
